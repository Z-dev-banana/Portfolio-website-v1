# Portfolio-website-v1
 Basic first version of portfolio website!

So far there's a TON of fat on this because I used a bootstrap template to start it off.

If you get stuck at the initial terminal portion of the site just type:

                         âœ¨  username anything   âœ¨

The terminal is mostly a gimmick to show off JS skillz, but I realize most people probably don't know how to interact with a terminal.

Tour around! Some buttons don't work correctly but I wanted to have something to stand up.

I used Javascript, and AnimeJS for the header and the weird svg particles in the Projects section.

HTML and CSS used for style AND swag obviously. ðŸ’ª ðŸ˜Ž
